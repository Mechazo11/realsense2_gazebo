# Realsense 2 RGBD camera description

A ROS 2 package to provide urdf, mesh and rviz files to simulate a Intel Realsense 2 RGBD camera. Uses ```RGBD``` camera plugin within ```Gazebo Harmonic``` or later.

### Acknowledgement

* Mesh and initial URDF files are taken from Rangel Isa√≠as Alvarado Walles's [realsense2_description](https://github.com/issaiass/realsense2_description). However to the best of my knowledge, Rangel's package is only compatible with Gazebo / Ignition Fortress or earlier Gazebo 11 both of which are near their `End-Of-Life`.
